# Imperative VS Declarative programming
Functional programming is declarative style of programming, as opposed to Object-Oriented and Procedural Programming styles which are imperative.
Which simply put means that functional programmingf focuses more on what things are as opposed to how to get them.

## Programming thought process example:

| Imperative - **How**        | Declarative - **Why**
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1. Set `x` to be equal to `0`    | |
| 2. Add the first number in the list to `x`    | `X` is the sum of all the numbers in the list, divided by the length of the list      |
| 3. Repeat step 2 for the rest of numbers that are in the list |    |
| 4. Divide `x` by the `length` of the list.

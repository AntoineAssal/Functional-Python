# First-Class Functions
In object-oriented programming, we generally treat data and functions as entirely different types of entities. We would never think of for example creating a list of functions or passing functions as arguments to other functions, or even stranger returning functions from other functions.

However, in functional programming, it's not only possible to do these things, it's in fact a source of tremendous flexibility, and this is exactly what we mean when we say that a language supports First-Class Functions. 

It allows us to treat functions in a very similar way to how we normally treat other values such as numbers or strings or objects. It gives us a lot of flexibility and greatly increases our opportunities for code reuse in ways that we'll see later on. It also allows us to do useful things like combine existing functions in order to create new functions. We'll see in a later section how this is done and what its implications for our programs.
